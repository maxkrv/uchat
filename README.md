To get started with Uchat, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the Makefile.

First of all you have to compile all static libs and repository code

`make`
After that [install gtk+3](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+install+gtk3) if you dont have it.

It provides RESTfull architecture and uses MVC architeture design.
UChat provides comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications.

### <img src="assets/openapi-logo.svg" width="20" height="20"/>OpenAPI Documentation <img src="assets/openapi-logo.svg" width="20" height="20"/>

The OpenAPI documentation describes the RESTful API endpoints and their corresponding request and response structures.

You can find doc at `server/docs/open-api.yaml`
How to open it? Google it if you are really interested 😉

(We used `OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor` VS code extenstion preview option)

### <img src="assets/asyncapi-logo.svg" width="15" height="15"/> AsyncAPI Documentation <img src="assets/asyncapi-logo.svg" width="15" height="15"/>

The AsyncAPI documentation provides information about websocket comunication

You can find doc at `server/docs/async-api.yaml`
How to open it? It is harder than open-api(couse it is not such popular).

You can use `asyncapi-preview` VS code extenstion preview option

### Happy chatting! 😄
